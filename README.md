# NESC-3505
NESC 3505 Portfolio Space
As a third-year student in NESC 3505, this was my first exposure to coding! What I've created are the pieces of information I found most interesting so far, which might help others present their work in a more aesthetically pleasing or efficient manner. 





Some of my favourite things I've written were for NESC 3505, albeit in a different format than normal. 
An example of this is [formatting style for info presentation](Formatting.md) 


Another important thing was [working with dataframes](Pandas_datafile_for_portfolio.md)


Once the dataframes and lists are set up, [exploring data analysis is a natural progression](EDA.md)


Exploring data is useful, but [visualizing data can be better for understanding it](Visualization.md)
