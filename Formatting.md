One of the most important things I've learned in coding is better presentation of code using formatting.

# Title of Whichever Resource We Extract Information From, or Project We Are Working On

Octothorpes (#) are one of my favourite parts of code because they give you not one, but 6 levels of headings which can help guide the reader to different levels of analysis in your code or presentation. Including title levels suitable for tables!

#### A Table of Meanings for Column Names and Values

|Column | Description|
| --- | --- |
|Tables can be used for:| Explaining values of binary coding- Wrong=1, Right=0|

Using |XX|XX| creates a table, and |--|--| creates the APA 7 friendly non-lined format separating the column headings and details of the table.
